**Create Single Python Executables for Easy Deployment**

Given Python's scripting design, developers struggle with putting Python into a concise structure (wrangling messy files everywhere, etc.). Learn a unique solution that coordinates two build tools to speed up development by packaging together your application seamlessly. You'll see how Bazel can coordinate python packages, and how Pex bundles those packages together into a single executable. Now, you can deploy a single executable with all your third party dependencies bundled alongside your application. We'll discuss the methodology, show a demo in action, you'll learn where to go to replicate this for your own application, and finally, we'll discuss the learnings and insights we discovered while struggling through the muck in coming to this solution.
